We are two friends - Mahafreed Irani and Aditya Kumar. We both have a common love for literature and everything that has to do with words and the written form. So we decided to read (and possibly write) together.


We read heavy books, light books, poems and essays. We even analyse hindi film lyrics. We then convert our analysis into notes and combine them together. We try to make some sense, and develop a common understanding out of those interpretations. Our individual, and sometimes unique, interpretations of texts adds to the other's understanding of it. It makes for better learning.


Two friends reading is an attempt to document those learnings that we have derived while reading. It also signifies something that we both believe in - that art of reading itself is an ongoing learning process. It never concludes.
